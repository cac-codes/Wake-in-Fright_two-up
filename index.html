    <p>The Australian New Wave film Wake in Fright(1971) contains scenes where the main protagonist, an English schoolteacher, staying in a semi fictional mining town plays a simple coin-tossing game; Two-up. </p>

    <p>Two-up is a traditional Australian gambling game, involving a designated "spinner" throwing two coins or pennies into the air. </p>
    <p>Players bet on whether the coins will fall with both heads (obverse) up, both tails (reverse) up, or with one coin a head and one a tail (a draw known as "Ewan").</p>
    <p>
      This gambling game cultural significance for Australians, as it was a popular pastime for Australian soldiers in the trenches and troop ships during World War I. The game is illegal most of the year but allowed on Anzac Day, 25 April, where there is a pretty good chance you’ll find a crowd of people playing it.

      <p>Each of these outcomes has the same probability: 1 in 4, or 0.25, assuming that the coins are fair and not biased. This means the chances of getting ‘heads’ or ‘tails’ is always the same, at 1 in 4, or 25%. However, the chances of getting ‘odds’ is higher, thanks to there being two different paths to this outcome: 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5, or 50%.</p>

      <p>Each coin toss is an independent event: the result of one coin toss does not influence the probabilities of any subsequent coin tosses. And yet, when we see something that seems strange and unlikely to us—like a run of five heads in a row—we think that, surely, the next throw must be tails... </p>

      <p>In the film's the main protagonist is drawn into a game initially makes significant winnings., before subsequently losing everything and finds himself stuck in a surreal purgatory.</p>

      <p>
    In these scenes the filmspresents what is known as the ‘gambler’s fallacy’, where we believe that continuous runs of a particular outcome will later be balanced out by a tendency for the opposite outcome to occur, even for entirely random and independent events. In cognitive psychology terms, this is called ‘negative recency’. </p>
    <p>
    We tend to expect that random events will look random, regardless of whether we’re looking at a short series of events (like a run of five coin tosses) or a larger set of results (all the coin tosses for that day’s game). If something doesn’t look as random as we expect it should look, we get suspicious.</p>
